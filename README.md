CLONING AND SETUP To clone and setup the project on your local machine,
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the command: "git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repro.git". Replace your-username and your-repro with your github username and the name of the repository. After the cloning process is done, open the cloned folder from the navigated directory. On the bar where the name of the directory is showing, type
"cmd" to open the terminal. When the terminal opens, type the command "code." to open your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then you are good to go. All you need to be doing is adding Commit and pushing changes to your GitHub account
What I have learned from the project This project has indeed helped me improve my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React). It also helped me master git and github, specifically how to fork a repo, how to create a pull request, and some git commands. In addition, I have learned how to build front-end projects faster and how to insert images in ReadMe.md.

LESSON LEARNT

This project has indead made me learn a lot of new things and has improved my skills a lot better the before. I learnt so much on HTML, CSS a bit of JavaScript, React and as well as Git and Github. Most importantly on git, i learnt how to fork a repo, how to  create a pull request and some gits commands as well. Lastly, i have learnt how to insert images in the read.me. This project has indeed been a lot heplful than i thought it would. I will say this project was a must to be done!
