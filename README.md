CLONING AND SETUP To clone and setup the project on your local machine,
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the command: "git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repro.git". Replace your-username and your-repro with your github username and the name of the repository. After the cloning process is done, open the cloned folder from the navigated directory. On the bar where the name of the directory is showing, type
"cmd" to open the terminal. When the terminal opens, type the command "code." to open your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then you are good to go. All you need to be doing is adding Commit and pushing changes to your GitHub account
What I have learned from the project This project has indeed helped me improve my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React). It also helped me master git and github, specifically how to fork a repo, how to create a pull request, and some git commands. In addition, I have learned how to build front-end projects faster and how to insert images in ReadMe.md.
