          As we know, the University of Ghana is the best university in Ghana. That being said and known, we lack no resoucres necessary for a good and perfect academic environment.
          Same goes for te Department of Computer Science.

          The Department of Computer Science has a lot of equipment in order for every student to recieve the best education any institution can offer.

          Also the department has necessary tools and equipment which will make teaching easier for lectures as well.

          All these include libraries, computer labs, projectors, big screens for easier learning and understanding and many more.
