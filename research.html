        <h2>RESEARCH AREAS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science research is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge and innovation. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to cryptography, data science, and computer vision. Researchers in computer science strive to develop new algorithms, models, and technologies that address complex problems and improve the efficiency, security, and usability of computer systems. They explore novel approaches to data analysis, explore the possibilities of quantum computing, and delve into the ethical implications of emerging technologies. Computer science research not only fuels advancements in technology but also has a profound impact on various industries, ranging from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. Through collaboration, experimentation, and rigorous analysis, computer science researchers continuously contribute to the advancement of our digital world, shaping the future of technology and society as a whole.
The research areas in the Department of Computer Science support our graduate and undergraduate programs. Research experience is an integral part of advanced undergraduate education, especially for students planning to enter graduate school.
